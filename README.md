Cristiano Ronaldo: -3.60

Christian Eriksen: -3.30

Wout Weghorst: -1.70

NOTE: 

Ronaldo's contract was terminated during the winter

Eriksen is a deep midfielder

Weghorst is a loan striker who joined in January

Therefore the worst xG with context is Weghorst, as he is a striker who's sole job is scoring goals
